# MyHTMLResume

Hello. This is my portfolio website hosted on Github pages.
I did an online course on Bootstrap and Responsive-Website building and utilized the knowledge to create my first custom project. It's based on HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Bootstrap, and javaScript. I enjoyed designing, implementing, and coding the amazing website experience.
